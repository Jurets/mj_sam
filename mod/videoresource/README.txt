Plugin: Video Resources

In a place outside of the course (in Moodle, but in administration, to allow for reusability across courses), 
the video resource will store a YouTube video ID, video description, some additional metadata. 
The system will also allow for storage of a URL for a podcast, and a long-text transcript. 
Admins will also be able to enter timecodes and descriptions as chapter markers.

Videos can be inserted anywhere in the course using a TinyMCE plugin. Once inserted, 
the system will generate an iFrame with the video, along with the description and metadata, 
a link to a pop-up with the transcript. Chapter-makers will be listed, and clicking them will 
control the iFrame player (code available). Event log will store all video events, and chapter marker usage. 
Videos can also be rated on a 5-star scale. Users may rate a video exactly once per course. 
Once rated, users will see the average rating of the video in that course.

Course and site admins can report on video activity across a course or across all courses, 
and see ratings across a course or all courses.
