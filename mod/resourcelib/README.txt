Plugin: Resource Library

The system will allow the creation on generic web links outside of the course. 
There are several fields of metadata that will be collected. This is done outside of the course to 
allow for reusability across courses. Resources will be organized into list subsections, 
and multiple subsections may be displayed at once.

In the course, a user can insert one or more lists (with subsections) on a single page. 
If the number of lists is greater than one, the lists (with subsections) will be displayed in tabs (using the Bootstrap framework code). 

Each resource will contain an icon, the title and link to a video, along with other metadata. 
The system will record clicks on each link in the event log. Users will also have the ability to rate 
each resource using a star rating system. They may select a rating one time per resource per course, and may not change it. 
Once a rating has been selected, the user will be able to see the average rating for the resource in that course.

Administrators will be able to report on resource usage and ratings across a single course or across all course instances.
